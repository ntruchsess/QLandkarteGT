To compile the code make sure you meet the following dependencies:

    * cmake - a make file generator  (>= Version 2.6)
    * QT 4 / Qtopia 4 - the famous GUI tool kit, (>= Version 4.4)
    * GDAL - Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (> Version 1.5.0, 1.5.0 is
buggy)
    * Proj4 - Cartographic Projections Library (>= Version 4.6)

Optional you might want to use:

    * libexif - to create wayoints from geotagged images
    * libdmtx - to summarize waypoints as  2D barcode


You can download the latest release as source code on SourceForge.There will be
a win32 binary, too.

For the bleeding edge of development you have to use the SVN repository. For
initial checkout:

    svn co https://qlandkartegt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qlandkartegt/QLandkarteGT/trunk QLandkarteGT

To build (out of source build, start one level above source root directory)1:

    mkdir build_QLandkarteGT 

    cd  build_QLandkarteGT 

    ccmake ../QLandkarteGT 

CCmake can be controlled by keys. Watch out for key hints at the bottom.
Especially the"c" and"g" key. Next you do:

    make

The binary will be placed in ./bin. To catch up latest changes (in the source
root directory):

    svn up

To send a patch (in the source root directory):

    svn diff > patchname.diff

As user you might want to do a

    sudo make install

to copy all stuff into your system.
