To compile the Win32 Port you have to checkout the GDAL sub-repo, too. The checkout
has to be in the same directory as this file:

svn co https://qlandkartegt.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/qlandkartegt/GDAL/

To run QLandkarte GT all files below the GDAL/bin path have to copied into the qlandkartegt.exe 
path.
